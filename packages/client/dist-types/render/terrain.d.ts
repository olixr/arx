/**
 * ORGANIC terrain rendering. Tiles are authored on a grid but the grid
 * must disappear on screen: material regions are contoured on the dual
 * grid (marching squares over tile corners), then every edge crossing
 * slides along its edge by a deterministic world-keyed hash and every
 * boundary run bows into a quadratic curve. Nature never cuts a 45°
 * chamfer — roads wander, meadows bite into sand, shorelines meander.
 * Masonry still may: layers with wobble 0 keep ruler-straight cuts
 * (stone plazas, wood floors), so man-made ground reads deliberate
 * while wild ground flows.
 *
 * Where two materials meet they BLEND, the way hand-drawn transition
 * tiles do: a worn shade band just inside the edge, grass tufts
 * overhanging the boundary, and crumbs of the material scattered out
 * onto the turf. Ground shading comes from low-frequency noise — big
 * soft meadows, no checkerboard.
 *
 * All jitter is keyed on WORLD tile coordinates, so the same curve
 * falls out of every chunk bake, every resolution tier, and the live
 * shoreline pass — geometry agrees everywhere by construction.
